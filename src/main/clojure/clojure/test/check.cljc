(defn quick-check
  "Tests `property` `num-tests` times.
  
  Takes several optional keys:

  `:seed`
    Can be used to re-run previous tests, as the seed used is returned
    after a test is run.

  `:max-size`.
    can be used to control the 'size' of generated values. The size will
    start at 0, and grow up to max-size, as the number of tests increases.
    Generators will use the size parameter to bound their growth. This
    prevents, for example, generating a five-thousand element vector on
    the very first test.

  `:reporter-fn`
    A callback function that will be called at various points in the test
    run, with a map like:

      ;; called after a passing trial
      {:type            :trial
       :args            [...]
       :num-tests       <number of tests run so far>
       :num-tests-total <total number of tests to be run>
       :seed            42
       :pass?           true
       :property        #<...>
       :result          true
       :result-data     {...}}
	   
      ;; called after the first failing trial
      {:type         :failure
       :fail         [...failing args...]
       :failing-size 13
       :num-tests    <tests ran before failure found>
       :pass?        false
       :property     #<...>
       :result       false/exception
       :result-data  {...}
       :seed         42}

    It will also be called on :complete, :shrink-step and :shrunk. Many
    of the keys also appear in the quick-check return value, and are
    documented below.

  If the test passes, the return value will be something like:

      {:num-tests       100,
       :pass?           true,
       :result          true,
       :seed            1561826505982,
       :time-elapsed-ms 24}
  
  If the test fails, the return value will be something like:
  
      {:fail            [0],
       :failed-after-ms 0,
       :failing-size    0,
       :num-tests       1,
       :pass?           false,
       :result          false,
       :result-data     nil,
       :seed            1561826506080,
       :shrunk
       {:depth               0,
        :pass?               false,
        :result              false,
        :result-data         nil,
        :smallest            [0],
        :time-shrinking-ms   0,
        :total-nodes-visited 0}}

  The meaning of the individual entries is:

      :num-tests
      The total number of trials that was were run, not including
      shrinking (if applicable)

      :pass?
      A boolean indicating whether the test passed or failed

      :result
      A legacy entry that is similar to :pass?

      :seed
      The seed used for the entire test run; can be used to reproduce
      a test run by passing it as the :seed option to quick-check

      :time-elapsed-ms
      The total time, in milliseconds, of a successful test run

      :fail
      The generated values for the first failure; note that this is
      always a vector, since prop/for-all can have multiple clauses

      :failed-after-ms
      The total time, in milliseconds, spent finding the first failing

      trial
      :failing-size
      The value of the size parameter used to generate the first
      failure

      :result-data
      The result data, if any, of the first failing trial (to take
      advantage of this a property must return an object satisfying
      the clojure.test.check.results/Result protocol)

      :shrunk
      A map of data about the shrinking process; nested keys that
      appear at the top level have the same meaning; other keys are
      documented next

      :shrunk / :depth
      The depth in the shrink tree that the smallest failing instance
      was found; this is essentially the idea of how many times the
      original failure was successfully shrunk

      :smallest
      The smallest values found in the shrinking process that still
      fail the test; this is a vector of the same type as :fail

      :time-shrinking-ms
      The total time, in milliseconds, spent shrinking

      :total-nodes-visited
      The total number of steps in the shrinking process

  Examples:

      (def p (for-all [a gen/nat] (> (* a a) a)))

      (quick-check 100 p)
      (quick-check 200 p

  * If a node fails the property, search its children
