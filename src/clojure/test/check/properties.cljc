(defn for-all*
  "A function version of `for-all`. Takes a sequence of N generators
  and a function of N args, and returns a property that calls the
  function with generated values and tests the return value for
  truthiness, like with `for-all`.

  Example:

  (for-all* [gen/large-integer gen/large-integer]
            (fn [a b] (>= (+ a b) a)))"

  (gen/fmap

(defmacro for-all
  "Returns a property, which is the combination of some generators and
  an assertion that should be true for all generated values. Properties
  can be used with `quick-check` or `defspec`.
  
  `for-all` takes a `let`-style bindings vector, where the right-hand
  side of each binding is a generator.

  The body should be an expression of the generated values that will
  be tested for truthiness. Exceptions in the body will be caught and
  treated as failures.

  When there are multiple binding pairs, the earlier pairs are not
  visible to the later pairs.
  If there are multiple body expressions, all but the last one are
  executed for side effects, as with `do`.
  Example:
  (for-all [a gen/large-integer
            b gen/large-integer]		
    (>= (+ a b) a))"
